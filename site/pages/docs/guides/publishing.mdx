# Publishing your app

Publishing Mini Apps involves providing information like who developed the app,
how it should be displayed, and what its capabilities are.

Since Farcaster is a decentralized network with multiple clients, publishing is
done by hosting a manifest file at `/.well-known/farcaster.json` on the domain
your app is hosted on rather than submitting information directly to a single
entity.

## Steps

::::steps

### Choose a domain

A Mini App is associated with a single domain (i.e. rewards.warpcast.com). This
domain serves as the identifier for your app and can't be changed later so
you should choose a stable domain. 

There's no limit on the number of apps you can create. You can create a separate 
domain specifically for development purposes if needed.

:::note
A domain does not include the scheme (e.g. https) or path. It can optionally
include a subdomain.
- ‚úÖ rewards.warpcast.com
- ‚ùå https://rewards.warpcast.com
:::


### Host a manifest file

Host a manifest file on your chosen domain at `/.well-known/farcaster.json`.

For now we'll create an empty file:

```sh
touch public/.well-known/farcaster.json
```

### Define your application configuration

A Mini App has metadata that is used by Farcaster clients to host your app. This
data is specified in the `frame` property of the manifest and has the following properties:

import ManifestAppConfigSchema from "../../../snippets/manifestAppConfigSchema.mdx"

<ManifestAppConfigSchema />

Here's an example `farcaster.json` file:

```json
{
  "frame": {
    "version": "1",
    "name": "Yoink!",
    "iconUrl": "https://yoink.party/logo.png",
    "homeUrl": "https://yoink.party/framesV2/",
    "imageUrl": "https://yoink.party/framesV2/opengraph-image",
    "buttonTitle": "üö© Start",
    "splashImageUrl": "https://yoink.party/logo.png",
    "splashBackgroundColor": "#f5f0ec",
  }
}
```

:::note
You can omit `webhookUrl` for now. We'll show you how to set it up in the
[sending notifications guide](/docs/guides/notifications).

## Verifying ownership

A Mini App is owned by a single Farcaster account. This lets users know who
they are interacting with and developers get credit for their work.

:::tip
Verified Mini Apps are automatically eligible for [Warpcast Developer
Rewards](https://warpcast.com/~/mini-apps/rewards) that are paid out weekly
based on usage and onchain transactions.
:::

![verified author ](/verified_author.png)

Verification is done by placing a cryptographically signed message in the
`accountAssociation` property of your `farcaster.json`. 

You can generate a signed account association object using the [Mini App
Manifest Tool](https://warpcast.com/~/developers/new) in Warpcast. Take
the output from that tool and update your `farcaster.json` file.

:::warning
The domain you host the file on must exactly match the domain you entered in
the Warpcast tool.
:::

Here's an example `farcaster.json` file for the domain `yoink.party` with the
account association:

```json
{
  "accountAssociation": {
    "header": "eyJmaWQiOjkxNTIsInR5cGUiOiJjdXN0b2R5Iiwia2V5IjoiMHgwMmVmNzkwRGQ3OTkzQTM1ZkQ4NDdDMDUzRURkQUU5NDBEMDU1NTk2In0",
