### Using localhost

If you are using localhost you'll need to make your local server publicly
accessible using a tool like ngrok or cloudflared so that Warpcast can scrape
embed information from your sever.

We recommend using cloudflared since it's free and quick to setup.

::::steps

#### Install cloudflared

```sh
brew install cloudflared
```

For more installation options see the [official docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/).


#### Expose localhost

Run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8080
```

Be sure to specify the correct port for your local server.o


#### Use the provided url

`cloudflared` will generate a random subdomain and print it in the terminal for
you to use. Any traffic to this URL will get sent to you local server.

Enter the provided URL in the Warpcast developer tool.
